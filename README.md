ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Tanmoy here!

 > `present:` java, microservices, kubernetes, kafka <br/>
 > `past:` iOS, messaging, XMPP, erlang, webRTC, react, signal encryption                       
 > `future/learning:` systems programming, rust, p2p networking, web3

I'm a software engineer with a focus on distributed systems, data modeling, messaging, and financial domains.

At present, I am primarily working on payment wallet microservices from the design to the deployment stage. Previously, I worked with messaging server backend and client apps, payment systems. 

Additionally, I am actively learning and contributing to the web3 and p2p networking domain with `Rust` as the primary language.

In general, I like spending lots of time exploring various random topics that pique my interest, solving [problems](https://github.com/MuhtasimTanmoy/playground), delving into open-source codebases, and making [contributions](https://github.com/MuhtasimTanmoy/Issue-tracker) to them.

#### Toy projects
  - [chainrs] - Experimental blockchain node built from scratch with rust
  - [rust playground] - Random code, snippets, materials, and documentation while learning rust
  - [trading journal] - Insights gained from quant trading and bot management 
  - [whiteboard] - Real-time video, audio, canvas, pdf sharing & gaming with peer js & webRTC
  - [notepad] - Exploring Meteor's real-time DDP protocol by building yet another notepad
  - [jpeg codec] - Experimentation with JPEG codec to study file format internals in C++
  - [webrtc arm64] - Unofficial distribution of WebRTC framework binaries built from source for only arm64 in obj C
  - [messaging server] - Messaging system to build in-app notifications using the socket in Golang
  - [riak-kv-benchmark] - Benchmarking riak with the Twitter dataset
