Hi there, I'm a software engineer residing in Dhaka, currently learning, evolving, and getting disciplined <br/>
in application programming, data modeling, messaging and financial domains.

At present, I am primarily working with `Swift`, and also expanding my knowledge of `Rust`. <br/>
In addition to that, I often spend my time exploring new tools, solving [problems](https://github.com/MuhtasimTanmoy/playground), delving into open-source <br/> codebases, and making [contributions](https://github.com/MuhtasimTanmoy/Issue-tracker) to them.

#### Toy projects
  - [chainrs] - Experimental blockchain node built from scratch with rust
  - [rust playground] - Random code, snippets, materials, documentation while learning rust
  - [trading journal] - Insights gained from quant trading and bot management 
  - [whiteboard] - Real time video, audio, canvas, pdf sharing & gaming with peer js & webRTC
  - [notepad] - Exploring meteor's real time ddp protocol by building yet another notepad
  - [jpeg codec] - Experimentation with JPEG codec to study file format internals in c++
  - [webrtc arm64] - Unofficial distribution of WebRTC framework binaries built from source for only arm64 in obj C
  - [messaging server] - Messaging system to build in-app notifications using socket in golang
  - [riak-kv-benchmark] - Benchmarking riak with twitter dataset
